# ü§î Why PlagiaSight?

Many "plagiarism detection" tools simply provide a basic "plagiarism percentage" without offering meaningful insight into the content. 

PlagiaSight addresses this limitation by offering a comprehensive analysis of text through multiple lenses, aiming to keep results clear and *interpretable*. Our tool doesn‚Äôt draw absolute conclusions but instead offers valuable statistics and guidance, allowing users to apply their own judgment.

#### Manual Installation (If Automatic Setup Fails)

If the above steps don‚Äôt work:

1. Delete the `venv` folder if it exists in the unzipped folder.
2. Open the terminal at PlagiaSight‚Äôs folder and run these commands:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv                # Create a new virtual environment
   source .venv/bin/activate            # Activate the virtual environment
   pip install -r requirements.txt      # Install dependencies
   python3 src/main.py                  # Run the app
   ```

Making the installation process smoother is a priority for us. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

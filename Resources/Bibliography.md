## __BIBLIOGRAPHY__
*Origin of the learning material used for this project (inspiring projects kept apart in* [InspiringProjects.md](https://github.com/Luckyyyin/PlagiarismDetectionProject/blob/main/Resources/Learning%20Material/InspiringProjects.md) , *continuously updated)*
This file is not as conceptually interesting as ResearchResources.md or even InspiringProjects.md, its purpose is to cite the authors of each work properly. Citing each work's authors in InspiringProjects.md would've made the document far less readable, so the actual citations have been moved here.

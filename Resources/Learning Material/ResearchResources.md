## __Useful Links towards learning material (ordered)__
This document is a reflection of our research for the project, in an effort to introduce ourselves to Natural Language Processing fundamental concepts. The links have been ordered in a way to help the reader understand our research and tought process better. 
Inspiring *projects* have been excluded from this file (and placed in InspiringProjects.md) for clarity purposes.

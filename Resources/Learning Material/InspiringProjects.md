A brief description of existing plagiarism checkers, and how they can help one building their own.

These projects have been ordered to follow a hierarchical order in terms of "complexity" and number of plagiarism detection concepts unknown of us, but please keep in mind that this order is absolutely not to be *strictly*  followed. Jumping across these projects to find the right ideas for ours will be our goal here.

1) [Simple-Plagiarism-Chercker by **abhilampard**](https://github.com/abhilampard/Simple-Plagiarism-Checker/tree/master)
    - Very simple detection methods; TF and cosine similarity
    - Basic usage of the `re` module, useful to learn about text conversions to lowercase and punctuation removal for instance
    
2) [PlagiarismRemover by **simranvolunesia**](https://github.com/simranvolunesia/PlagiarismRemover)
    - basic method of synonyms detection in a text
    - simple, yet enlightening usage of the `nltk` library
    
3) [Plagiarism Checker by **mozzaart23**](https://github.com/Moozzaart23/PlagiarismChecker/tree/master)
    - Slightly more advanced detection methods; TF-IDF (to span the analysis across multiple documents) and KL Divergence
    - Usage of interesting librairies: notably `pandas`, `numpy`, `nltk` (as well as `re`)
    - Project built over multiple files, effectively making the understanding of the whole easier for readers by making the structure of the whole project clear
    
4) [Text-Mining by **ShreshthSaxena**](https://github.com/ShreshthSaxena/Text-Mining)
    - An actual assignment for school/uni, it seems; could give us ideas to structure our code and project files rigorously
    - Usage of unseen concepts for us; similarity matrix, Jaccard index, hierarchical clustering, LSA (we'll probably not use all of these, since the "Text-Mining" projects allows an analysis on multiple docs at a time)
    - Heavy usage of extern librairies

5) [Writing-Styles-Classification-Using-Stylometric-Analysis by **Hassaan-Elahi**](https://github.com/Hassaan-Elahi/Writing-Styles-Classification-Using-Stylometric-Analysis)
    - Not really a plagiarism checker, but a great source of ideas to analyze a text reinforced by a fleshed-out documentation
    - Probably "too advanced" at our current level to fully understand; could be used to foreshadow certain concepts that we would discover along the making of this project
